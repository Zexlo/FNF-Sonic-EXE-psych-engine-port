The original mod source can be found [on Github](https://github.com/CryBitDev/Sonic.exe-source#readme).  
This port serves as a light weight alternative to the cancelled and buggy V2.5/3 builds while having the benefit of mod support and (most) songs from current and planned future releases, this port exeedes the original in various ways: overall filesize is roughly a quater of the V2.5 build (1.25GBS), making for a much less storage costly experience, as with psych engine, mods can be applied to this port to alter/add content however you see fit! many of the bugs V2.5 introduces are not present in base Psych engine allowing you to experience a more polished take on the cancelled builds.
